"""
Configuration Module for Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) Tool

This module provides a central configuration class for the SER application. It defines
various settings and parameters used throughout the tool, including emotions, feature
extraction configuration, neural network parameters, audio file read parameters, dataset
configuration, model configuration, transcript configuration, and default language settings.

Classes:
    - Config: Contains all configuration settings for the SER application.
